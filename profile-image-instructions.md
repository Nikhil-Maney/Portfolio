# Profile Image Placeholder

To replace the placeholder profile image with your actual LinkedIn profile image:

1. Download your profile picture from LinkedIn
2. Save it as "profile-image.jpg" in this folder
3. Open the `index.html` file and find this section:
   ```html
   <div class="profile-image">
       <!-- Uncomment and update the src when you have your image -->
       <!-- <img src="profile-image.jpg" alt="Nikhil Abhiram Naidu Maney"> -->
       N
   </div>
   ```
4. Uncomment the image tag by removing the <!-- and --> markers
5. If your image has a different filename, update the "src" attribute accordingly

Your profile image will then appear in both the main portfolio page and the cover page.
