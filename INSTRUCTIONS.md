# How to View Your Portfolio Website

## Option 1: Using Python HTTP Server (Recommended)

1. Open your command prompt or terminal
2. Navigate to the portfolio directory:
   ```
   cd c:\Users\E953691\Python\portfolio
   ```
3. Run the Python server:
   ```
   python server.py
   ```
4. Open your web browser and go to: http://localhost:8000/

## Option 2: Using Node.js Server

1. Make sure you have Node.js installed
2. Open your command prompt or terminal
3. Navigate to the portfolio directory:
   ```
   cd c:\Users\E953691\Python\portfolio
   ```
4. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
5. Start the server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```
6. Open your web browser and go to: http://localhost:3000/

## Option 3: Opening the HTML File Directly

1. Navigate to the portfolio folder in File Explorer
2. Double-click on the `index.html` file to open it in your default web browser

Note: Some features may not work correctly when opening the file directly, which is why using a server is recommended.

## Making Changes

1. Edit the HTML, CSS, or JavaScript files as needed
2. If using a server, save your changes and refresh your browser to see the updates
3. Customize the content to match your experience and preferences
